Unable to check whether the code is in the value set http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/ValueSet/us-core-encounter-type|5.0.1
# APPROVED by HL7 Cross Group Projects WG: Profiles do not derive from one of the base US profiles because they do not align with any of the US Core Observations (https://confluence.hl7.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=97453270)
US FHIR Usage rules require that all profiles on Observation derive from one of the base US profiles
# Examples have optional slices that are not defined in the profile - not matching is expected behaviour
This element does not match any known slice defined in the profile http://hl7.org/fhir/us/bfdr/StructureDefinition/Bundle-document-bfdr|1.1.0
# Expected behaviour - added an extra author for this example
TODO
# Issue is because the slices aren't recognized due to the missing ICD-10 code system 
TODO
# The 5.0.1 US Core that this IG depends on does not contain us-core-coverage
