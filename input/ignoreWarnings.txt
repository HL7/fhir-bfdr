# Example uses a CPT code that can't be validated
Code System URI 'http://www.ama-assn.org/go/cpt' is unknown so the code cannot be validated
# Example uses an identifier not specifically called out by a slice
This element does not match any known slice defined in the profile http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition/us-core-organization
# Example specifically uses a value not in this value set
# APPROVED by HL7 Cross Group Projects WG: Profiles do not derive from one of the base US profiles because they do not align with any of the US Core Observations (https://confluence.hl7.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=97453270)
US FHIR Usage rules require that all profiles on Observation derive from one of the base US profiles
# Examples have optional slices that are not defined in the profile - not matching is expected behaviour
This element does not match any known slice defined in the profile http://hl7.org/fhir/us/bfdr/StructureDefinition/Bundle-document-bfdr
# Expected behaviour (one profile is parent of the other)
