# This is a publisher induced issue.   The extension in question is introduced by the publisher, not sushi.   See https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/stream/179252-IG-creation/topic/New.20ConceptMap.20Warning.20--.20induced.20by.20IG.20Publisher 
The modifier extension http://hl7.org/fhir/1.0/StructureDefinition/extension-ConceptMap.element.target.equivalence from FHIR version {3} is not allowed to be used at this point (allowed = e:ConceptMap.element.target; this element is [[BackboneElement, ConceptMap.group.element.target]; this is a warning since contexts may be renamed between FHIR versions)

# The target code system is not published by NCHS, but is well known to implementers
The Source Code System IJE is not fully defined and populated, and no sourceScope is specified, so the source code checking will not be performed

# This is not relevant for our application
Best Practice Recommendation: In general, all observations should have a performer
Best Practice Recommendation: In general, all observations should have an effective[x] ()

# This has been reviewed
The repeating element has a pattern. The pattern will apply to all the repeats (this has not been clear to all users)
