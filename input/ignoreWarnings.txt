# APPROVED by HL7 Cross Group Projects WG: Profiles do not derive from one of the base US profiles because they do not align with any of the US Core Observations (https://confluence.hl7.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=97453270)
US FHIR Usage rules require that all profiles on Observation derive from one of the base US profiles
# Examples have optional slices that are not defined in the profile - not matching is expected behaviour
This element does not match any known slice defined in the profile http://hl7.org/fhir/us/bfdr/StructureDefinition/Bundle-document-bfdr|1.1.0
