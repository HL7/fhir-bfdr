This includes infections present at the start of pregnancy or confirmed diagnosis during pregnancy with or without documentation of treatment. Documentation of treatment during this pregnancy is adequate if a definitive diagnosis is not present in the available record.

This concept is mapped to:
* Item **42. Infections present and/or treated during this pregnancy** in the *[U.S. Standard Certificate of Live Birth (rev. 2003)](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/dvs/birth11-03final-ACC.pdf)*

This profile is based on and further constrains the [US Core Condition](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition/us-core-condition) profile.
