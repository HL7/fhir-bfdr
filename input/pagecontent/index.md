### Overview

### Overview
Birth and fetal death reporting includes the transmission of data from health care providers to jurisdictional Vital Records Offices and national health statistics agencies. Data associated with the mother of the baby or fetus may be communicated independently from that associated directly with the labor and delivery encounter at the responsible healthcare facility. Note that for the purposes of this guide, “mother” always refers to the woman who delivered the infant. In cases of surrogacy or gestational carrier, the information reported should be for the surrogate or the gestational carrier, that is, the woman who delivered the infant.
