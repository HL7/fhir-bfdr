### Overview

Project Scope: The purpose of this project is to create an HL7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources implementation Guide (FHIR BFDR IG) standard to support the needs of NCHS and its jurisdictions to successfully implement the electronic reporting of birth and fetal death information. The scope of this HL7 FHIR BFDR IG will include the content of medical/health information on live births and fetal deaths for select state and Federal birth and fetal death reporting, as indicated in the 2003 Revision of the U.S. Standard Certificate of Live Birth and the U.S. Standard Report of Fetal Death. Additionally, it will include the content that is exchanged between EHRs, jurisdictions, and NCHS. In the case of fetal death, return coded cause of death, and race and ethnicity information back to the state.

Project Need: To continue support of interoperability among public health systems, there is a need to develop a FHIR IG for birth and fetal death reporting. Development of the FHIR IG for birth and fetal death will provide national data standards that will support the implementation of FHIR for NCHS, Jurisdictional partners and EHR vendors.
