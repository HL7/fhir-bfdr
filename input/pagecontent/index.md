### Overview

### Description

Birth and fetal death reporting includes the transmission of data from health care providers to jurisdictional vital records offices and national health statistics agencies. Data associated with the mother of the baby or delivered fetus may be communicated independently from data associated directly with the labor and delivery encounter at the responsible healthcare facility. Note that for the purposes of this guide, &quot;mother&quot; always refers to the woman who delivered the infant or fetus. In cases of surrogacy or gestational carrier, the information reported should be for the surrogate or the gestational carrier, that is, the woman who delivered the infant. Also, the national statistics agency referred to in this guide is the [National Center for Health Statistics - CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/index.htm) (NCHS).

This implementation guide (IG) defines a series of Health Level Seven (HL7®) Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR®) profiles on the Composition resource to represent electronic birth and fetal death reporting (BFDR). It includes the content of medical/health information on live births and fetal deaths for select state and federal birth and fetal death reporting, as indicated in the [2003 Revision of the U.S. Standard Certificate of Live Birth](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/dvs/birth11-03final-ACC.pdf) and the [2003 Revision of the U.S. Standard Report of Fetal Death](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/dvs/FDEATH11-03finalACC.pdf). Additionally, it includes the content that is exchanged between electronic health record (EHR) systems, jurisdictions, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention/ National Center for Health Statistics (CDC/NCHS).

### Relationship to Other Standards
This BFDR IG standard complements other vital records standards to support the expansion of information flows to and from the national statistics agency. The BFDR STU 1 drew on foundational work of early standards listed in the Background section, below. This current version of the BFDR IG is informed by :
* [HL7, Vital Records Death Reporting (VRDR) FHIR Implementation Guide](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/vrdr/)
* [Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC), United States Core Data for Interoperability (USCDI)](https://www.healthit.gov/isa/united-states-core-data-interoperability-uscdi)

### Dependencies
This implementation guide re-uses and further constrains profiles from the following guides:
* [US Core Implementation Guide, STU5.0.1](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/STU5.0.1/)
* [Vital Records Common Profiles Library](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/vr-common-library)
* [Occupational Data for Health (ODH)](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/odh/)

### Audience
This guide is for analysts and developers who require guidance on the use of the HL7 FHIR for providing birth and fetal death reporting information. The IG is informative to health care provider organizations, jurisdictional vital records offices, CDC/NCHS, health information exchange organizations, and other vital records fetal death reporting stakeholders.

### Background 
This FHIR IG builds on previous electronic data standards for transmitting vital records of death, birth, and fetal death. 
* [HL7, Version 2.6 Implementation Guide: Vital Records Birth and Fetal Death Reporting](https://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=320)
* [HL7, CDA® R2 Implementation Guide: Birth and Fetal Death Reporting](http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=387)
* [IHE , Quality, Research and Public Health Technical Framework Supplement - Birth and Fetal Death Reporting-Enhanced (BFDR-E)](https://www.ihe.net/uploadedFiles/Documents/QRPH/IHE_QRPH_Suppl_BFDR-E.pdf)

This IG provides standardized data strutures for transmission of reliable and relevant clinical information to jurisdictional vital records offices and transfer of information from vital records offices to the national statistics agency. 

Electronic vital records work started with the HL7 Vital Records Domain Analysis Model (VR DAM), published as an Informative Specification in 2011. The VR DAM was updated in 2017 with the HL7 Cross-Paradigm Domain Analysis Model: Vital Records, Release 2, in 2018, with Release 3, and in November 2020 as Release 4. [VR DAM, Release 5](http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=466) was published in May 2022. Implementers who review or reference the VR DAM should note that the active vital records FHIR IGs (such as BFDR and VRDR) may no longer aligned with the VR DAM. 

This FHIR IG uses the US Core profiles. Where this FHIR IG is unable to use a US Core profile, we have followed the Cross Group Projects Work Group's variance request process, and have provided the US Realm Steering Committee an approved rationale for deviation in the IG.
