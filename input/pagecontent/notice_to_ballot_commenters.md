While we are expecting that balloter will comment on all areas of this Implementation Guide (IG), the following are areas on which we are specifically seeking comments:
* [Transport](transport.html)
* [Capability Statement](CapabilityStatement-CapabilityStatement-bfdr.html)
* The creation and use of the [Extension - Date Part Absent Reason](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/vr-common-library/StructureDefinition-Extension-date-part-absent-reason.html)
    * Note: this extension is part of the Vital Records Common Library but is used in this IG
