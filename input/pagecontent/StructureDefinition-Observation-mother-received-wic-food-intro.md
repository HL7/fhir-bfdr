This concept is mapped to:
* Item **34. Did mother get WIC food for herself during this pregnancy?** in the *[U.S. Standard Certificate of Live Birth (rev. 2003)](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/dvs/birth11-03final-ACC.pdf)*
* Item **28. Did mother get WIC food for herself during this pregnancy?** in the *[U.S. Standard Report of Fetal Death (rev. 2003)](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/dvs/FDEATH11-03finalACC.pdf)*

***Reason for not basing on US Core - no suitable Observation profile.***
