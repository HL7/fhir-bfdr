It contains data that are a coded form of the race and ethnicity data that has been submitted to the the national statistics agency.

Two sets of codes will be used to address two objectives. These objectives are:
* to generate codes for race or ethnicity data provided as text entries
* to generate a single race code in cases where multiple races have been reported

In addition, when the coding process has led to duplication of data, the duplicates will be eliminated. 

Coded race and ethnicity data is communicated for both the mother and father in the case of live birth and only for the mother in the case of fetal death.
