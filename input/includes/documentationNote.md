####  January 2024 Ballot of STU2

The STU2 versions of the BFDR and VRCL FHIR IGs are part of an effort to [harmonize and reduce duplication](vr_ig_harmonization.html) among FHIR IGs for vital records and medico-legal investigation.
As a result of this effort there has been a significant realignment of content among these FHIR IGs.   The tables below show the provenance of all current content of the BFDR STU2 IG, as well as content that was previously included and has been moved, superceded, or obsoleted.
